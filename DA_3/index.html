    <h2>OMG! LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
            This game is an adventure game with a completely original concept of signing yearbooks
        </li>

        <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
            My game features a CSV overworld map and multiple tile types, as well as yearbook sprites.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
            I am having trouble getting states to work for this game. I enjoyed creating the CSV map.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
            <a href="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/b/b6/Trick_House_puzzle_room_1_RS.png/180px-Trick_House_puzzle_room_1_RS.png">book.png</a>

        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
            This game most closely resembles the Phaser 2 Tile Mapping example
        </li>

        <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            It's the last day of school! You must sign all the yearbooks before time runs out.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
            Last day of school.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
            The variety comes from the inconsistency of the player, as the game is technically demanding.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            Movement, strategy, precision.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            The player should be excited to learn the best strategies to get to all the yearbooks in time.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            Use the arrow keys to move your character. Avoid water that clumsy students have spilled on the school floor.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            Ride along walls for an easier time avoiding spilled water.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
            A middle schooler on the last day of school.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            All gamers.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            A minute or less.
        </li>

    </ul>
