<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is a two-player game that is played on one laptop. The game uses completely original artwork and sprites, as well as an original concept.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My game has multiple objects you need to avoid (the bird and the cacti). The physics are interesting because the bird moves slower than the worm, making it possible for the worm to avoid him if he plays correctly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about the way game objects work when making this game. The hardest part was probably finding movement constants that felt good and fun to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    <a href="https://www.free-stock-music.com/desert-dance.html">desert-dance.mp3</a> - FSM Team
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game most closely resembles the Phaser 2 Tutorial Game. I borrowed a lot of the code concepts from that game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The worm is trying to last as long as he can from the bird in the hot, dry desert. Unfortunately, the cacti are not making this easy for him.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The hero's journey.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The bird and worm players both must mix up their actions each time they play in order to be unpredictable.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Movement; escape.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The players' hearts should be racing the entire time they are playing this game. The worm must run for his life, and that should be apparently in the emotions of the players. The bird is hungry and he MUST EAT!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Worm: The worm is trying to escape from the bird. He moves using the arrow keys, using up to jump. The worm may not collide with any cacti either. The worm moves slightly faster than the bird.

Bird: The bird is starving and is looking for his next meal. The bird moves using WASD. Even though the bird is slower than the worm, he is much tougher than the worm and can handle the sharp cacti.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
For the worm, the goal is to mix up platform movement and execute correctly to avoid cacti. The bird should try to bait the worm into making a predictable movement so that he can catch his prey.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A worm and a bird find themselves in the desert. How long can the worm survive before nature takes its course?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes an exciting thriller can play my game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About a minute per round.
</li>
